# 100-Days_of_RTL-by-AzamSathik

Hello, This is Azam and i'm an EEE Undergraduate and I make this Repo for my Learning Purposes.This list covers a wide array of digital design concepts, from basic combinational and sequential circuits to more complex systems like processors and controllers. Each day you can work on designing, coding, and testing the circuit, and as you progress, youâ€™ll build up a comprehensive portfolio of digital designs.
Happy Learning...
